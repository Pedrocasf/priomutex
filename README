priomutex:  a mutex where waiting threads specify a priority
============================================================

The API is very similar to std::sync::Mutex.  The key difference, of course, is
that lock() takes a priority.  If multiple threads are waiting for the mutex
when it's freed, the one which gave the highest priorty will recieve it.

    impl<T> Mutex<T> {
        fn new(data: T) -> Mutex<T>;
        fn lock(&self, prio: usize) -> LockResult<MutexGuard<T>>;
        fn try_lock(&self) -> TryLockResult<MutexGuard<T>>;
    }

    impl<T> Drop for MutexGuard<T>;      // Releases the lock
    impl<T> Deref for MutexGuard<T>;     // For accessing your data
    impl<T> DerefMut for MutexGuard<T>;  // For accessing your data

This crate also includes a high-performance variant in the spin_once module,
which spins the highest-priority waiting thread.  This makes releasing the
mutex very fast, because it never needs to do any syscalls.
